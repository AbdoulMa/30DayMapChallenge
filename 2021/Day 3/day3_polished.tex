Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, \textbf{7.9 per cent} of the
worldâ€™s workforce, or approximately \textbf{260 million workers},
were home-based workers.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions  on movement and gatherings shifted these numbers dramatically. Overall, the ILO estimated that close to \textbf {18 percent of world's workers} are in occupations and live in countries with the infrastructure that allow them to work from home.
Regional variations were also wide: around \textbf{30 per cent of North American and Western European workers} were estimated to be in occupations that allowed home-based work ass opposed to only \textbf{6 per cent of Sub-Saharan African and 8 percent of South Asian Workers}.
